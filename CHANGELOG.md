# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.11.0] - 2025-11-26

### Added
- **Retry Logic**: Implemented a robust retry mechanism for database writes. If the database is unreachable, events are buffered in memory (up to `max_queue_size`) and retried later.
- **Attribute Exclusion**: Added `exclude_attributes` configuration option (YAML and UI) to filter out specific attributes from being recorded.
- **Query Service**: Added `scribe.query` service to execute read-only SQL queries from Home Assistant.
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive `TECHNICAL_DOCS.md` and updated `README.md` with "Scribe vs Recorder" comparison and troubleshooting guide.
- **Issue Templates**: Added GitHub issue templates for bug reports and feature requests.

### Changed
- **Scripts**: Generalized `deploy.sh` and `drop_db.sh` for public use (removed hardcoded paths).
- **Defaults**: Harmonized default values between UI and YAML configuration.
- **Logging**: Improved logging for connection errors and buffer status.

### Fixed
- **Sensors**: Resolved `AttributeError` in sensor initialization.

## [1.10.0] - 2025-11-25

- **Translations**: Added translations for new configuration fields.

## [1.9.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added
